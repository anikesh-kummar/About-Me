# 👋 Hi, I'm Anikesh Kumar

I’m a first-year Electrical Engineering student at **Parala Maharaja Engineering College**, **Berhampur**, Odisha.  
I'm passionate about **Cybersecurity** and exploring the intersection of **hardware and software hacking** — integrating my core Electrical Engineering skills into both **online security** (Linux, Python, Networking) and **physical exploits** (microcontrollers, hardware manipulation).

---

## 🧠 What I'm Focusing On

- 🐧 **Linux**: Mastering terminal, bash scripting, and penetration testing with Kali Linux  
- 🐍 **Python**: Writing scripts for automation, reconnaissance, and exploitation  
- 🌐 **Networking**: TCP/IP, OSI model, Wireshark, Nmap, and traffic analysis  
- 🔌 **Hardware Hacking**: Building circuit-based tools using Arduino/Raspberry Pi for physical attacks and sensing environments  
- 🔒 **Cybersecurity**: CTFs, ethical hacking labs, and security tool development  
- 🧰 **Tools I Use**: Kali Linux, Python, Bash, Docker, VirtualBox, Wireshark, Git

## 📘 My Repositories

Here’s where I document my journey and build real stuff while I learn:

- 🔹 [Linux Notes](https://github.com/anikesh-kummar/linux-notes):  
  My cheat sheets, commands, and concepts from learning Linux as a hacker OS  

- 🔹 [Python Scripts](https://github.com/anikesh-kummar/python-scripts):  
  Small tools and automations I build while learning scripting for cybersecurity  

- 🔹 [TryHackMe Writeups](https://github.com/anikesh-kummar/thm-writeups):  
  Solutions, walkthroughs, and lessons from TryHackMe labs and rooms  

Coming soon:

- 🔸 **hardware-hacking**: Documenting how I use my EE circuits and sensors in real-world hacking setups  
- 🔸 **ctf-journal**: Writeups and thought process from solving CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges

## 🛠️ What Makes Me Different

While most go deep into just software, I’m developing a rare combo:

🔐 **Cybersecurity** (software side)  
🔧 **Hardware Security** (physical/electronic side)  

Using my EE knowledge to understand how devices work *inside-out*, and how they can be protected — or exploited. I want to go beyond coding and *actually touch the system* — both virtually and physically.

## 🎯 Future Goals

- 🛡️ Become a **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** and complete OSCP certification  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Contribute to India's cybersecurity and national intelligence missions  
- 🧠 Master both **digital (software)** and **physical (hardware)** aspects of hacking  
- 🏆 Participate and win national/international CTF competitions  
- 🔬 Research and build tools that combine electrical signals with security vulnerabilities  
- 📢 Share my journey through GitHub, LinkedIn, and security blogs to inspire others like me

🔭 I’m documenting everything publicly — from the first line of code to advanced attacks — not to show off, but to **learn in public** and maybe inspire someone who's starting just like me.

If you're also into cybersecurity, electrical hacks, or just curious, feel free to follow or reach out.  
Let’s learn and build together. 💻⚡
